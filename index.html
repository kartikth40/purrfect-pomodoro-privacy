    <main>
      <p>Purrfect Pomodoro Timer is designed to help you manage your time effectively and stay focused. Your privacy is important to us. This extension is built with privacy in mind.</p>

      <h3>🔒 What we don’t collect</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your name, email address, or any direct personal information.</li>
        <li>No browsing history, website content, or personal activity is transmitted to any server.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🌐 Permissions</h3>
      <p>Purrfect Pomodoro Timer requests certain permissions that may look broad (such as the ability to “read and change data on all websites”). We want to be clear:</p>

      <p>✅ These permissions are only used to enable features you control — specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To block or redirect websites that you choose during focus sessions (using <code>declarativeNetRequest</code>).</li>
        <li>To ensure your productivity sessions are distraction-free as you’ve configured them.</li>
      </ul>

      <i>We do not access or modify the content of websites you visit, beyond enforcing the site blocking you’ve set up.</i>

      <h3>📊 Analytics</h3>
      <p>Purrfect Pomodoro Timer uses <strong>PostHog</strong>, a privacy-conscious analytics platform, to help us understand how the extension is used so we can improve it over time.</p>

      <p>We collect non-personally identifiable information, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anonymous user IDs (generated by PostHog or our extension)</li>
        <li>Events related to timers, focus sessions, and site blocking (including the domains/hostnames you choose to block)</li>
        <li>Feature usage (e.g., enabling settings, starting/stopping timers)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>This data is used solely to improve the extension’s functionality and user experience. We do not sell or share this data with other third parties.</h4>

      <i>We believe in transparency and privacy-first design. Our permissions and data collection are limited to what’s necessary to deliver the features you choose to use.</i>

      <p>If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kartik.pomodoro@gmail.com">kartik.pomodoro@gmail.com</a>.</p>
